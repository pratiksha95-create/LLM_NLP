## Natural Language Processing/ Speech Processing: 
Build a chatbot that can understand context from a collection of speech data.
Open-source/proprietary models can be used. 
The language model should be an instruction fine-tuned model. 
The speech data should be embedded into a vector database for retrieval.










Build an agent-based language models system that can take in different roles to complete tasks.
The input prompt should be a task that the system needs to complete.
The system should create task-specific workers that should interact to get the task done. 
The final output can be in text format.
